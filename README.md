# Machine Learning

Starting to learn about Machine Learning, let's go! 
Here we are gonna talking about what is machine learning and some little concepts around it but that doesn't all, we'll code cause is what we loved! so what we are waitting for.

# Let's start talking about what is Machine Learning

Maybe, both You and I have heard about Machine Learning before, and maybe both You and I have thought how it works and what are there inside that strange black box. Sure, that is the reason why You are reading this.
Don't worry if you don't know anything about it, maybe me neither :'( but together we will achieve it!

There are many definitios about what is Machine Learnig wich you can get browsing in Internet, but there are one wich I preffer cause is really simple.

*The science of making computers act without being explicitly programmed* by Andrew NG.

So, for me that's mean you can code the computer to it learn by it self how make the hard work instead of you!, that's sound good for me.
